1.1 GameMode gathers all Custom Actors on the level (map) using UGameplayStatics::GetAllActorsOfClass

1.2 If any CustomActor is found, create a TMap<ACustomActor*, int> of them with their static meshes' number of vertices

1.3 With the number of vertices on a separate Tarray<int>, quicksort them

1.4 Create an FVector PositionMap starting at "StartingPosition" and for each index offset the FVector position by "OffsetPosition"

// 2 sorting

2.1 Extract a TArray<Vector> from the PositionMap for later comporison (since maps don't have indexes)

2.2 Loop through all actors and sort their position by number of vertices when they match with one of the sorted array of vertices elements

// 3 resetting

3.1 Simply loop through all Custom Actors and set their target position to be their StartingPosition

// 4 UI

4.1 Created a HUD and used Slate to create a CompoundWidget for the buttons
